- 👋 Hi, I’m @adilumer, a software developer with a Physics background.

- 👀 I’m interested in development on all programs, but as one can't carry a load of watermelons at once, I am focusing on backend development with Node.js and PostgreSQL; and native iOS development with Swift. Almost all of my personal projects and work-related responsibilities are based on these technologies. I did start with C\C++ and used C#.Net back in 2009 for a while but a lot has changed on .Net side since then. I later switched to web based applications (and JS) as I really love the flexibility of JavaScript and the rate of evolution of web-based technologies really pulls me in. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning React for frontend development as angular.js that I already know is slowly losing popularity and community support is ending. I have been a fan of jQuery since I was 10th grade or so and jQuery was something new and wonderful; (It still is wonderful IMO :)) but one has to adapt to conjuncture. I also had a peek at Kotlin as I plan to develop android apps for personal projects, but that journey has to wait. 

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to JavaScript and PostgreSQL - really.
