## 💻 My Coding Journey

My programming journey began in 2009 with C/C++ and C#.Net, coupled with low-level projects as a hobbyist. My physics background introduced me to LabView, providing hands-on experience in experimental setups and hardware-software integration. This interdisciplinary approach has shaped my problem-solving skills, combining analytical thinking with technical expertise. As my career progressed, I expanded into web and mobile development, exploring various languages and frameworks. My experience spans backend systems, database management, and native iOS development. I continuously seek to broaden my skill set, embracing new technologies and methodologies to create efficient, scalable solutions across different domains.
