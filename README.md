# 👋 Hello, I'm Adil Umer

### 🌟 Software Developer with a Passion for Innovation

I’m a dedicated software developer with a keen interest in creating impactful solutions across multiple platforms. While my curiosity spans the entire development ecosystem, I've honed my focus on backend development with **Node.js** and **PostgreSQL**, and native iOS development with **Swift**.

### 💻 My Journey
I began my coding adventure with **C/C++** and dabbled in **C#.Net** back in 2009, though the .Net world has evolved significantly since then. My shift towards web-based applications led me to discover the flexibility and dynamism of **JavaScript**, a language that continues to inspire me.

### 🔧 What I'm Working On
Most of my projects, both personal and professional, revolve around the technologies I love:

- **Node.js** & **PostgreSQL** for building robust and scalable backend solutions.
- **Swift** for crafting elegant and responsive iOS applications.

I’m currently expanding my skill set with **Angular** for frontend development. Although I’ve always admired **jQuery** (a fondness that goes back to my 10th grade), I’m adapting to modern frameworks as the tech landscape evolves. I’ve also started exploring **Kotlin** with plans to venture into Android app development soon.

### 🤝 Let's Collaborate
I’m eager to collaborate on anything related to **TypeScript/JavaScript** and **PostgreSQL**. Whether it's contributing to open-source projects or brainstorming new ideas, I’m always up for a challenge.
